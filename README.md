> A high-performance proxy server with user-based authentication and traffic statistics.

**Proxy Centauri** (aka **Procent**) is a proxy server that provides a single entry point for routing traffic through multiple proxy providers with per-user configuration and detailed statistics aggregation.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

> [!WARNING]
> This project is currently under active development. APIs and features may change.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **User-based authentication** - Basic auth with credentials database
- 📊 **Detailed statistics** - Per-user ingress/egress traffic monitoring
- 🚦 **Rate limiting** - Concurrency and traffic limits per user
- ⚡ **High performance** - Built with Tokio async runtime
- 🧪 **Well tested** - 16 tests with integration coverage
- 🔧 **Configurable** - Environment-based configuration
- ✅ **CI/CD** - GitHub Actions with clippy + tests

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75 or higher
- Cargo

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/proxy-centauri.git
cd proxy-centauri
cargo build --release
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
PROXY_PORT=9090
PROXY_HOST=127.0.0.1
```

### Running

```bash
cargo run --release
```

The proxy server will start on `127.0.0.1:9090` (or your configured address).

## 📖 Usage

### Connecting through the proxy

Configure your client to use the proxy:

```bash
# Using curl
curl -x http://procent:o953zY7lnkYMEl5D@127.0.0.1:9090 https://example.com

# Using environment variables
export HTTP_PROXY=http://procent:o953zY7lnkYMEl5D@127.0.0.1:9090
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://procent:o953zY7lnkYMEl5D@127.0.0.1:9090
```

### Default credentials

- Username: `procent`
- Password: `o953zY7lnkYMEl5D`

Or:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `12345`

> [!NOTE]
> Credentials are currently hardcoded in `lib/auth.rs`. In production, use a proper authentication backend.

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run specific test
cargo test test_proxy_auth_required
```

### Test Coverage

**Integration tests (8):**
- ✅ Proxy authentication required (407)
- ✅ Unauthorized access (401)
- ✅ Method not allowed (405)
- ✅ Successful CONNECT tunnel (200)
- ✅ Malformed request handling
- ✅ Server cleanup on drop
- ✅ Traffic limit exceeded (403)
- ✅ Concurrency limit exceeded (429)

**Unit tests (8):**
- ✅ Limiter logic (concurrency/traffic)
- ✅ User context management
- ✅ Limit checking priority

## 📊 Statistics

The proxy tracks per-user traffic statistics:

```
User `procent` stats:
    ingress: 1056 bytes
    egress: 5618 bytes
```

Statistics are logged every 10 seconds during runtime.

## 🛠️ Development

### Building

```bash
# Debug build
cargo build

# Release build
cargo build --release

# Check without building
cargo check
```

### Linting

```bash
cargo clippy
```

Configured with `pedantic` lints in `Cargo.toml` (`nursery = "allow"`).

### Formatting

```bash
cargo fmt --all
```
